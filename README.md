# Cab Fare Calculator 🚕

This is a small C project I made to calculate cab fare.  
It takes the distance and cab type (Mini, Sedan or SUV) from the user  
and shows the total cost including base fare and 5% GST.

### 🧠 Concepts Used
- C Concepts: Loops, If-Else, Switch Case, Functions, Variables  
- Math Concepts: Multiplication, Percentage (for GST), Simple Formula  

### ⚙️ How to Compile
```bash
gcc main.c -o cab_fare_calculator -lm

how to run : ./cab_fare_calculator# coc-project-jecrc
